# Dark Patterns Privacy Testing Research
**Goal of this document**
  * Develop something that can be used along side the Digital Standard
  * Develop the pieces that need to exist directly inside the Digital Standard to fully asssess user experience
  * Figure out what should be and can be tested with respect to good/bad user design

### Things we want to measure (re: Privacy)
**What is the default flow for any path-of-least-resistance user?**
 * Explore the space of possibility
 * What are the settings and features in question?
 * What are the defaults for those settings?
 * Which settings explicitly define what they control?
 * Which settings give sufficient fidelity on control?

**How easy is it to choose the privacy friendly option (including account deletion)?**
  * Hidden defaults? 
  * How many clicks does it take to enable?
  * Are there even settings to do so?
  * Are the buttons the same size, position, color, font? 
  * Does the UX use buttons too tiny, blocked, or inactive to select, etc.?
  * Does the UI fool users into interacting with it?
    * Boxes that suddenly appear under your finger
  * Are there false notifications or distractions?

**How easy is it to change defaults before finalizing account creation?**
  * Does the user have the ability to tailor their experience based on privacy?
  * Is the user interface designed to push the user to prefered use of service rather than explore settings (FB example from over the summer where a notification bubble distracted users from exploring settings)

**Is the user repeatedly nagged or pressured to make decisions contrary to their privacy?**
  * Are there dialogs or prompts that appear repeatedly to ask for contacts, location, etc.?
    * Especially onerous when the user has already set a setting to not allow access
  * Does the interface imply a sense of timing that is designed to pressure the user into making a quick decision? (aka forced timing)
  * Does the user have access to nuanced notification controls? 
  * Does the site use forced timing or crafted/artificial urgency mechanisms? (i.e., ticket sites)

**Are there elements of the user interface designed to distract users when they are about to make a choice about their privacy?**

**Are users clearly notified and able to clearly read instructions and policies that impact their privacy?**
  * Are privacy policies presented in a reasonable fashion that you can access later?
